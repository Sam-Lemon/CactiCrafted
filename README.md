## My process


### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - Bootstrap
  - Bootstrap Grid


### What I learned

  Using Bootstrap for the first time was quite challenging but as I powered through it 
  began to click. It took me a minute to figure out how to make the navbar horizontal
  but eventually I landed on:
  
    ```html
          <nav class="navbar navbar-expand bg-success navbar-light">
              <div class="container-fluid d-flex flex-row-reverse">
    ```
  
  But the most important lesson of this project is that perserverance is key.

### Continued development

  My plan is to just keep practicing so that I become more fluent in HTML and Bootstrap.

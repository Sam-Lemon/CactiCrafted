## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap
- Bootstrap Grid


### What I learned

Using Bootstrap for the first time was quite challenging but as I powered through it 
began to click. It took me a minute to figure out how to make the navbar horizontal
but eventually I landed on:
```html
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand bg-success navbar-light">
        <div class="container-fluid d-flex flex-row-reverse">

```

But the most important lesson of this project is that perserverance is key.

### Continued development

My plan is to just keep practicing so that I become more fluent in HTML and Bootstrap.
